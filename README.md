# CS325-AI
Emory University CS325 Artificial Intelligence Course Spring 2017

Based off the UC Berkeley Pacman project - http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

This course involves designing a pacman agent using python to learn basic, adversarial and stochastic search algorithms, and reinforcement learning concepts

Projects Overview
UNIX/Python Tutorial 
This short UNIX/Python tutorial introduces students to the Python programming language and the UNIX environment.


Search 
Students implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.


Multi-Agent Search 
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.


Reinforcement Learning 
Students implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.


Ghostbusters 
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Students implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.


Classification 
Students implement standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits. Students extend this by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.


Contest: Pacman Capture the Flag 
Students create strategies for a team of two agents to play a multi-player capture-the-flag variant of Pacman.
